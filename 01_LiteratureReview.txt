    Control solution without planning. Prioritize maneuvering to the starboard side when in vessel encounter.
    How they choose the {reference trajectory}/{reference state}?

    Contribution:
        * COLREGS-Compliant Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for position and velocity tracking of underactuated surface vessels, and collision avoidance of static and dynamic objects.
        * Introduce the concept of integrating collision avoidance into the trajectory tracking controller, based on MPC concepts, to act as a last-line of defense for autonomous vessels.
    Approach:
        * 3 DOF dynamic model using two control variables: surge force and yaw moment.
        * External disturbances are cosidered as constant or slowly varying disturbances.
        * A nonlinear disutrbance observer is used to estimate disturbances and enhance the robusteness of the controller.
        * For collision avoidance the authors modeled time-varying contrains into the trajectory control, considering both static and dynamic obstacles.
        * Collision avoidance constraints are added to the problem that force the vessel to deviate minimally from the defined path in case of predicting a collision while obeying some of the added to the problem that force the vessel to deviate minimally from the defined path in case of predicting a collision while obeying some of the rules of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS).
        * Obstacles are assumed to have circular shape and collision avoidance is translated into an inequality constraint, integrated into the controller design
        * The method is validated through software simulation using MATLAB.
    Comparison:
        * Maneurving prioritizing starboard
        * Solution based on control using modified MPC
        * No real-world test
        * Assumed capability to detect and identify the velocity, course and lenght of other vessels 
    CA:
        * The motion prediction of encountered vessels is predicted using the constant velocity (CV) model presented in (Rong Li and Jilkov, 2003).
    Global Guidance:
    Local Guidance:
    Navigation:
        * Assumed radar or LiDAR
            - Position of the obstacles
        * Assumed AIS/Approach
            - Velocity, course, and lenght of the vessel
    Control: NMPC
    COLREGS: 13, 14, 15

        * Prioritize to maneuvering to the starboard side ("the optimization problem will be reformulated by adding a soft constraint on the rate of change of yaw moment to prioritize the ship maneuvering to the starboard side")

Agrawal2015COLREGS

    Contribution:
        * COLREGS-Compliant Target Following for an USV in Dynamic Environments
    Approach:
        * The motion prediction for the target vessel is based on Monte-Carlo sampling of dynamically feasible and collision-free paths with fuzzy weights
        * This prediction is continuously optimized for a particular target by learning the necessary parameters for a 3-degree-of-freedom model of the vessel and its maneuvering behavior from its path history without any prior knowledge
