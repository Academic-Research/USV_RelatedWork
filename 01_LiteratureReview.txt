    Control solution without planning. Prioritize maneuvering to the starboard side when in vessel encounter.
    How they choose the {reference trajectory}/{reference state}?

    Contribution:
        * COLREGS-Compliant Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for position and velocity tracking of underactuated surface vessels, and collision avoidance of static and dynamic objects.
        * Introduce the concept of integrating collision avoidance into the trajectory tracking controller, based on MPC concepts, to act as a last-line of defense for autonomous vessels.
    Approach:
        * 3 DOF dynamic model using two control variables: surge force and yaw moment.
        * External disturbances are cosidered as constant or slowly varying disturbances.
        * A nonlinear disutrbance observer is used to estimate disturbances and enhance the robusteness of the controller.
        * For collision avoidance the authors modeled time-varying contrains into the trajectory control, considering both static and dynamic obstacles.
        * Collision avoidance constraints are added to the problem that force the vessel to deviate minimally from the defined path in case of predicting a collision while obeying some of the added to the problem that force the vessel to deviate minimally from the defined path in case of predicting a collision while obeying some of the rules of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS).
        * Obstacles are assumed to have circular shape and collision avoidance is translated into an inequality constraint, integrated into the controller design
        * The method is validated through software simulation using MATLAB.
    Comparison:
        * Maneurving prioritizing starboard
        * Solution based on control using modified MPC
        * No real-world test
        * Assumed capability to detect and identify the velocity, course and lenght of other vessels 
    CA:
        * The motion prediction of encountered vessels is predicted using the constant velocity (CV) model presented in (Rong Li and Jilkov, 2003).
    Global Guidance:
    Local Guidance:
    Navigation:
        * Assumed radar or LiDAR
            - Position of the obstacles
        * Assumed AIS/Approach
            - Velocity, course, and lenght of the vessel
    Control: NMPC
    COLREGS: 13, 14, 15
    COLREGS:    
        * Prioritize to maneuvering to the starboard side ("the optimization problem will be reformulated by adding a soft constraint on the rate of change of yaw moment to prioritize the ship maneuvering to the starboard side")

        Target following (focusing on surveillance/env.monitoring).


    Contribution:
        * COLREGS-Compliant Target Following for an USV in Dynamic Environments
        * 
            (1)A single-stage, COLREGS-compliant and dynamically feasible path planner, that generates a trajectory which can be directly navigated over at nearly full surge speed, instead of navigation at lower speed to enforce COLREGS over a non-COLREGS- compliant trajectory. 
            (2) Increasing the accuracy of the mo- tion prediction by 12% over the best of previous methods in representative dynamic obstacle scenarios without a dramatic increase in computation.
    Approach:
        * The motion prediction for the target vessel is based on Monte-Carlo sampling of dynamically feasible and collision-free paths with fuzzy weights
        * This prediction is continuously optimized for a particular target by learning the necessary parameters for a 3-degree-of-freedom model of the vessel and its maneuvering behavior from its path history without any prior knowledge
        * Based on (1) fully observable world in a grid representation, (2) previous and current states of USV and tearget vessel and (3) 3-DOF dynamic model of the USV.
        * 3 Stage path definition:
            1 motion estimation of the target vessel
            2 identify COLREGS ocndiions that apply to the situation considering neighboring vessels
            3 A* search
        * CPA to determine if the USV is about to collide with another vessel
    Comparison:
    Global Guidance:
        * M-MC
        Path planning using grid-based map and A* with Artificial Terrain COsts for dynamically changing obstacles
        * target following motion

    COLREGS:
        1 if dCPA_tmax < dCOLREGS: identify which scenario
        2 Add hysteresis
        3 if dt0 < dCRITICAL avoid without compute COLREGS strategy
        * modification of obstace map introducing new obstacles an terrain cost
        * fusing the COLREGS rules directly with the dy-namic A* heuristic path-planning around dynamic obstacles by imposing Artificial Terrain Costs,
    Validation: 
        * Tests that simulate multiple civilian and adversarial vessels
        * Through software simulation and rea-world tests
        * Simulation in 15 different Environments
            - 5 each with no obstacles, static obstacles, and dynamic obstacles
        * Comparison with:
            - Pure pursuit
            - Constant Bearing
            - Simple Monte Carlo
            - Results in simulation show least travelled distance and travveles time and most computational time in all scenarios for the M-MC proposed method in comparison to PP, CB and MC.
        * Field Tests:
            - The field tests were performed on Panther Hollow Lake in Pittsburgh PA, USA
            - 1.8m-long kayaks fitted with underwater-scooter motors on either side for propulsion, batteries, computers, compass, GPS, LIDAR scanners for obstacle detection and RF receivers for manual control
            - 1 civil vessel
            - distance travelled and time taken were 52.2% and 70.1% of the under PP motion-estimation

Benjamin2004COLREGS

    Contribution:
        1 - Detailed Discussion about the appliance of COLREGS to USVs and overview of the "COLREGS project", showing simulation and field test modelling.
        2 - Detailed evaluation why USV must be compliant to COLREGS
            2.1 - Discuss the fact that the COLREGS were written for humans and the problems related to this fact
                2.1.1 COLREGS 14
                    * The rule states that course io the starboard is required, but does not specify the angle or ultimate clearance distance required between the two vessels.
        3 - Behavior-based control for integration of COLREGS-compliant collision avoidance and mission accomplishment.

    Approach:
        1 - Multi-objective optmization, interval programming to coordinate behavior.
        2 - Each of the COLREGS rules is captured in a distinct behavior that may or may not be influencing the overall control of the vehicle at any given moment.
        3 - The output of each behavior is an objective function that rates all possible actions with respect to the corresponding COLREGS rule.
    Comparison:
        1 - Shallow modelling and presentation of Results
        2 - pioneer
        3 - similar strategy (shortest-path algorithm)
        4 - Do not explore the combination of global and local guidance
        5 - Maybe similar simulation in the aspect of use perfect information about USV's position and other vessels/obstacles's position and trajectory
    Global Guidance:
        1 - For global guidance they use a behavior-based approach, considering mission and COLREGS obsjectives to perform the coordination of the USV.
        The output of each behavior is an obejective function that rates all possible actions with respect to the corresponding COLREGS. So, they use interval programming to solve the multi-objective optimization problem.
        2 - The COLREGS behaviors rate possible vehicle actions in a decision space defined by the decision variables course, speed, and intended-time.
        3 - A shortest-path algorithm is run.
    Local Guidance:
    Navigation:
        1 -  The vehicle is given a commercially available bathymetry map which, in effect, defines its free space.
        2 - Real boat:
            1 - GPS
            2 - compass
            3 - Linux, Mission Orieted Operating simulate
            4 - libs and apps written in GNU C++
        
    Control:
    COLREGS:
        1 - Different behaviors and actions for each CORLEGS rule.
    COLREGS:
        1 - 14 - Head-On, 16 - Give-Way Vessel, 
    Validation:
        0 - Tracking through passive or active sensors is outside the current project scope.
        1 - Simulation:
            1 - In simulation, the controlled vehicle knows its own position perfectly, as well as the position and trajectory of all other moving vessels.
            2 - In simulation presented the behavior related to the head-on situation.
        2 - Field Tests:
            1 - In the in-water experiments, the vehicle knows its own position from GPS, and each vehicle broadcasts its GPS position to each other.
            2 - 4 10-foot kayaks
            3 - on-board computers
            4 -
